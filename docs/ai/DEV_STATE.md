# Dev state

## 2026-10-05 maintenance

- General Ask Health cross-domain synthesis was hardened for questions combining body, nutrition, and training evidence.
- Ask Health now uses a smaller structured-output contract, retries JSON mode if Gemini rejects the schema, and tolerates harmless response-shape differences without accepting fabricated evidence refs.
- Personal claims stay evidence-grounded, while established general health/physiology context can be used as clearly qualified possibilities.
- Ask Health prompt version is `ask-health-v3`.
- No migration or environment-variable change is required.
- Recipe edits can now save a new current version when linked ingredient nutrition (including fiber/sodium) has changed; immutable prior versions remain intact.
- Recipe update review now surfaces fiber/sodium completion and uses owner-facing “update” language instead of treating version creation as the primary action.

Snapshot recorded 2026-09-30 after **V2-H4 — Experience System**.

## Current product state

The app now includes the H1–H3 functional foundation plus the H4 presentation/progression system.

High-frequency experience:

- Today is Nutrition-first.
- Coach is compact and progressively disclosed.
- Daily Quest is not displaced by Stretch.
- XP is globally visible and visually distinct.
- Rewards separates Spendable XP from Lifetime progression.
- Theme Studio controls full visual packs independently from System/Light/Dark.
- Lifetime XP drives Levels/theme unlocks.
- Progress signals can express toward/away/neutral and conservative motivating defaults without replacing the underlying finding detail.
- Reduced-motion remains authoritative.

## Schema

Repository migration head:

`0040_goal_training_units_fix.sql`

0040 repairs the Training Goal unit constraint introduced by H2D application behavior.

## Important H4 runtime fixes

- local Nutrition date query handling now matches production;
- local `.env.local` values can override `.env` defaults;
- Coach loading reserves final compact geometry;
- mobile Nutrition Add Food CTA is viewport-bounded;
- owner-facing standalone dates use readable month/day/year presentation;
- Progress motivating signals preserve the specific finding text.
